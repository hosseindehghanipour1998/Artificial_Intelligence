# Weighted Linear regression
>Dataset: Dataset2.txt

The effect of outliers on linear regression method have been analyzed in the previous part. Here, you have to apply weighted linear regression on the dataset which includes outliers.
  - Derive the closed form solution for weighted linear regression(WLR).
  - Propose a weighting function which decreases the effect of outliers with a formula. Explain why it could be appropriate.
  - Normalize the dataset (similar to the previous part).
  - Apply weighted linear regression using your suggested weighting function and find:
    - The closed form solution.
    - gradient descent (batch or stochastic) solution (with enough epochs).
  - Plot the outlier dataset and the models obtained from both the previous and the current part on the same figure. Compare the results of parts A and B. (2 figures)
  - When and how does WLR work better than simple linear regression?
