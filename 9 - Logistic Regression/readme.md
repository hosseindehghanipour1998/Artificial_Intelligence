# Classification (Logistic Regression)
Dataset: [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
Section A (Binary Classification)
  - The Iris dataset consists of 4 features and 3 classes. Use only the first and second features (remove the third and fourth columns) and also delete the instances of the _’Iris-versicolor’_ class to reduce the data to 2 classes with 2 features.
  - Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test.
  - Report the training and testing errors, and the equation of the decision boundary.
  - Also, plot the decision boundary along with the samples of the two classes with different colors all in one plot.
